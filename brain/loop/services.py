"""Cognitive-loop background-service startup (Phase 4A, extracted from the
ORRIN_loop entrypoint).

`start_background_services()` brings up the daemons the loop depends on but does
not drive: the ToolRunner (drains queued tool requests), the EvaluatorDaemon
(delayed reward resolution), the always-on Layer-0 embodiment threads
(setpoint_regulation, sensory_stream, drive_engine, social_presence,
subconscious), and the optional continuous Executive daemon. The embodiment /
Executive starts keep no handle (they own their own threads); the loop needs the
ToolRunner + Evaluator handles back for its per-cycle health-watchdog + ticks, so
those are returned. Each start is fail-safe.
